\usage{
step_center(recipe, terms, role = NA, trained = FALSE, means = NULL)

\method{learn}{center_step}(x, data, na.rm = TRUE, ...)

\method{process}{center_step}(x, data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{terms}{A representation of the variables or terms that will be centered.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{means}{A named numeric vector of means. This is \code{NULL} until computed by \code{\link{learn.center_step}}.}

\item{x}{a \code{center_step} object that specifies which columns will be centered.}

\item{data}{A tibble or data frame that contains the training set.}

\item{na.rm}{A boolean indicates whether to remove NAs, default TRUE.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods (not currently used).}

\item{x}{A trained \code{center_step} object.}

\item{data}{A tibble or data frame that has numeric variables that will be centered.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods (not currently used).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{center_step}.

An object of class \code{center_step}.

A tibble of processed data.
}
\description{
This function is a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that will normalize numeric data to have a mean of zero.

For a training set of data, this function computes the sample mean across numeric columns that require centering. Note that no data are centered by this function; see  \code{\link{process.center_step}}.

For a trained \code{center_step} object, this function will subtract the sample mean obtained from the training set from column in the current data.
