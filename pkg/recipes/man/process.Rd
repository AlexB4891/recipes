\usage{
process(x, ...)

\method{process}{recipe}(x, newdata = x$template, roles = "all", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A trained object such as a \code{\link{recipe}} with at least one preprocessing step.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods (not currently used).}

\item{newdata}{A data frame or tibble for whom the preprocessing will be applied.}

\item{roles}{A character vector to choose which types of columns to return (e.g. "predictor"). By default all columns are returned.}
}
\value{
A tibble that may have different columns than the original columns in \code{newdata}.
}
\description{
