\title{Train a Data Recipe}
\usage{
learn(x, ...)

\method{learn}{recipe}(x, training = x$template, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object}

\item{training}{A data frame or tibble that will be used to estimate parameters for preprocessing.}

\item{verbose}{A logical that controls wether progress is reported as steps are executed.}
}
\value{
A recipe whose step objects have been updated with the required quantities (e.g. parameter estimates, model objects, etc). Also, the \code{term_info} object is likely to be modified as the steps are executed.
}
\description{
For a recipe with at least one preprocessing step, estimate the required parameters from a training set that can be later applied to other data sets.
