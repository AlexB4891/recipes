\usage{
step_log(recipe, terms, role = NA, trained = FALSE, base = exp(1),
  vars = NULL)

\method{learn}{step_log}(x, training, info = NULL, ...)

\method{process}{step_log}(object, newdata, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{terms}{A formula that represents the variables or terms that will be processed. The raw variable names can be used or \pkg{dplyr} selection tools. See \code{\link{selections}} for more details.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{base}{A numeric value for the base.}

\item{vars}{A character string of variable names that will be (eventually) populated by the \code{terms} argument.}

\item{x}{a \code{step_log} object that specifies which columns will be transformed}

\item{training}{A tibble or data frame that contains the training set.}

\item{info}{A tibble with information on the current set of columns in the design matrix.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods (not currently used).}

\item{object}{A trained step object.}

\item{newdata}{A tibble or data frame that has numeric variables that will be transformed}
}
\value{
\code{step_log} and \code{learn.step_log} return objects of class \code{step_log}.

\code{process.step_log} returns a tibble of processed data.

\description{
\code{step_log} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that will log transform data.

For a training set of data, \code{learn.step_log} configures the log transformation (by basically doing nothing). This function is \emph{not} intended to be directly called by the user.

\code{process.step_log} is used to transform columns on specific data sets. This replaces values in the original columns. This function is \emph{not} intended to be directly called by the user.
